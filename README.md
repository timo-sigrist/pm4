## Makefile Usage

This project includes a Makefile with commands for building and running different components of the project using Docker. Here are some of the commands you might find useful:

### Building Docker Images

- `make build-backend`: Builds the Docker image for the backend part of the project.

- `make build-frontend`: Builds the Docker image for the frontend part of the project.

- `make build`: Builds the Docker images for both the frontend and backend parts of the project.

### Running the Project

- `make run`: Runs the Docker containers for the project using Docker Compose. This command starts up all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including the frontend, backend, and any databases or other dependencies.

- `make stop`: Stops all running Docker containers associated with the project's Docker Compose configuration. This command brings down all the services that were started with `make run`.
